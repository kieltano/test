          A voyage through history.
        </h3>

        <p>
          Around the 1400s it has been said that Leonardo da Vinci, painter of the
          Mona Lisa came up with marvellous ideas such as the flying machines and the armoured car
          while standing up at an easel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 1979 an English dissenting minister during an era where some rich homes and offices
          were equipped with standing desks “A sedentary life may be injurious. It must therefore be
          your resolute care to keep your body as upright as possible when you read and write; never stoop
          your head nor bend your breast. To prevent this, you should get a standing desk.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas Jefferson in the 1700s designed a tall table desk with 6 pegs to increase stability.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the early years of science and innovation, standing desk have evolved from a simple and basic
          structure to fit todays demand and inovation to reduce muscular fatigue and improve productivity.
        </p>

        <h3>Our journey</h3>

        <p>
          Nestled in the heart of a bustling city, my father, an office worker, spent long hours glued
          to his desk, battling with back pain and fatigue. During an appointment at the local health
          care, my grandfather discussed this matter with his doctor, and he was informed that his
          son should spend more time standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determined to help his son feel better, Grandfather built various prototypes of tall desks.
          When introduced to the office, he started feeling better, and both his productivity and posture
          improved. After a while, the demand for tall desks started growing, and dad had to leave his job to assist Grandpa
          in his workshop to anticipate the demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Year after year, newer models were created. As soon as new technologies were discovered,
          they were combined with the concept of tall desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Standing Desk Ltd. continues to innovate and inspire with a commitment to
          helping people live healthier lives. Every moment at our desk creates an opportunity
          to rise above the ordinary and reach a new height of success.
